# Coding Assignment: 

Create an iOS native app with Swift.
Load the following HTML page: (1)	

http://m.levi.com/US/en_US/categories/category~men~jeans~all/products

When User clicks on any product they will get redirected to the next page i.e. Product Details Page (2). 

An “Add to Bag” button is visible on this page. Using any javascript framework, change the Button text from “Add to Bag” to “Pay”
When User clicks the “Pay” button, invoke a Swift method and display native Pop up window with one Text field for user to enter a Credit Card number and an “OK” button.

When User clicks the OK button, redirect the user to the Order confirmation html page (3)
(this can be a custom html page included in the app).

On this Order Confirmation html (3) page, display the Product details (Product Name, Image and Price) that were selected on the Product Details Page (2) and an additional text “Your order has been accepted”.
